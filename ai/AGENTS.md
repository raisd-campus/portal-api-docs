# Raisd campus — agent instructions

These instructions apply to **every** repository under `raisd-campus` unless a portal-specific file under `frontend/` narrows them. Read this file before changing code or documentation.

**Knowledge base root:** this directory (`docs/ai/`).  
**Product baseline:** [`docs/sdd/`](../sdd/).  
**Organization:** [raisd-campus](https://github.com/raisd-campus).

## 1. Read order (any task)

1. This file.
2. [architecture/overview.md](architecture/overview.md) and [architecture/repositories.md](architecture/repositories.md).
3. The portal or service file that owns the change:
   - Student UI → [frontend/student-portal/AGENTS.md](frontend/student-portal/AGENTS.md)
   - Applicant UI → [frontend/applicant-portal.md](frontend/applicant-portal.md)
   - Lecturer UI → [frontend/lecturer-portal.md](frontend/lecturer-portal.md)
   - Staff UI → [frontend/staff-portal.md](frontend/staff-portal.md)
   - Portal API / identity / campus config → [backend/portal-api.md](backend/portal-api.md)
   - Existing Cyberjaya CMS inventory / CAP comparison → [backend/old-cms-cyberjaya.md](backend/old-cms-cyberjaya.md), [backend/cms-feature-comparison.md](backend/cms-feature-comparison.md)
4. Matching SDD (`docs/sdd/04`–`08`, `12`, `14`) for the delivery contract. Jump any `CAP-*` / `M*` via [SDD-15 nomenclature](../sdd/15-nomenclature.md).
5. [MANIFEST.yaml](MANIFEST.yaml) if you need to discover related documents.

## 2. Product boundaries (campus-wide)

- **Four portals, one existing CMS.** Applicant, Student, Lecturer, and Staff are separate webs. They talk only to the **Portal API**. They never write directly to Postgres or the existing CMS.
- **Cyberjaya first.** Admissions before semester registration. Core mobile at launch means phone-friendly agreed journeys, not a verified native-app mandate.
- **This phase — ADR-1 (confirmed Aslam, 23 Sep 2026):** keep the existing Cyberjaya CMS as system of record; build modern portal experiences via the Portal API; **do not duplicate** operational functions. Inventory and CAP mapping: [backend/cms-feature-comparison.md](backend/cms-feature-comparison.md).
- **Longer term:** progressive **unified one-stop CMS**, only on verified gaps with an explicit migration strategy ([M5](../sdd/03-delivery-milestones.md#m5)+ backlog — not launch rewrite). See [architecture/overview.md](architecture/overview.md) and [SDD-03](../sdd/03-delivery-milestones.md).
- **Demo ≠ Live.** Sample data and session-only mutations are Demo. Live requires durable save through the Portal API (or approved production path), server-enforced authz, and a named owner.
- Do not present planned or speculative capabilities as implemented.
- Do not invent campus policy, legal basis, EMGS outcomes, or tax treatment beyond what the knowledge base already records as prototype assumptions.

## 3. Repository map

| Repository | Owns | Agent entry |
|---|---|---|
| `control-plane` | Campus config, identity, Portal API, SDD, **this knowledge base** | this file + [backend/portal-api.md](backend/portal-api.md) |
| `student-portal` | Enrolled-student web (current deepest Demo UI) | [frontend/student-portal/AGENTS.md](frontend/student-portal/AGENTS.md) |
| `applicant-portal` | Online registration (Admissions launch) | [frontend/applicant-portal.md](frontend/applicant-portal.md) |
| `lecturer-portal` | Lecturer web | [frontend/lecturer-portal.md](frontend/lecturer-portal.md) |
| `staff-portal` | Registry / Faculty / Bursary / QA / Marketing | [frontend/staff-portal.md](frontend/staff-portal.md) |
| `design-system` | Shared tokens/components (emerging) | [design/design-system.md](design/design-system.md) |
| `portal-api-docs` | Public OpenAPI + Swagger (GitHub Pages) | [backend/portal-api.md](backend/portal-api.md) |

Local checkouts are siblings under `~/src/raisd/`. See [architecture/repositories.md](architecture/repositories.md).

## 4. Architecture rules agents must not violate

- Portal API write success only after the CMS acknowledges the write (when Live/CMS-connected).
- Authorisation is server-enforced. Client-side role hiding is not security.
- Evidence, assignments, and payment proofs need a durable file store for Live; metadata-only demos are not Live.
- Hosting: existing UltaHost VDS / staged k3s plan in [architecture/deployment.md](architecture/deployment.md) and [SDD-12](../sdd/12-deployment-architecture.md). Do not invent a greenfield cloud topology without an ADR update.
- CAP IDs are shared across portals: the same CAP on two portals is one capability, two role surfaces ([SDD-11](../sdd/11-capability-catalog.md)). Quick links: [SDD-15](../sdd/15-nomenclature.md).

## 5. Documentation duties

- When behaviour changes, update the canonical knowledge file under `docs/ai/` **and** the matching SDD or capability note in the same change.
- Use [process/generate-documentation.md](process/generate-documentation.md) to produce or refresh human-facing SDD sections, architecture PDF inputs, and public docs from this base.
- Update [MANIFEST.yaml](MANIFEST.yaml) when adding or removing knowledge files.
- Do not rely on a previous chat as project context. Prefer handoff + this knowledge base.

## 6. Working rules

- Inspect `git status` before editing. Preserve unrelated user changes.
- Prefer small, reusable changes. Do not silently change an agreed product policy.
- If a request conflicts with this knowledge base or an SDD, surface the conflict and confirm before coding.
- Never commit `.env`, CMS credentials, or live student data.
- Do not commit or push unless the user explicitly asks.

## 7. Maintaining these instructions

Update this `AGENTS.md` when campus-wide scope, architecture, repository layout, status language, or documentation process materially changes. Keep portal feature detail in `frontend/<portal>/` rather than growing this file into a feature log.
